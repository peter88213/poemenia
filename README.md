# The poemenia extension for OpenOffice

Localize the OpenOffice [Pepito Cleaner](https://pepitoweb.altervista.org/pepito_cleaner/index.php) extension. 

Pepito Cleaner is a handy extension that can be used to detect and correct common errors, such as those that occur when extracting text from PDF documents. This is done mainly with configurable search patterns, so-called regular expressions. 

The default regular expressions in Pepito Cleaner recognize quotation marks as they are common in the USA, also  _guillemets_  as used for example in Italy and Switzerland. In order for Pepito Cleaner to recognize the in Germany and Austria commonly used inverted commas („…“) and chevrons (»…«) as opening and closing quotation marks, the user has to change the regular expressions himself. However, such changes require expertise and are not easy to transfer to other installations. Moreover, they will be lost again when Pepito Cleaner is updated or reinstalled.

Since Pepito Cleaner seems to be no longer maintained, the developers are not identifiable, and the license terms of the software are unknown, I have programmed the extension  _poemenia_, which helps to localize a Pepito Cleaner installation from the outside. Currently the option is available for Germany and Austria (de-DE).

For more information and German translation, see the [project home page (German)](https://peter88213.github.io/poemenia/) with description and download instructions.
