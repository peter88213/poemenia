Pepito Cleaner is a handy extension that can be used to detect and correct common errors, such as those that occur when extracting text from PDF documents. This is done mainly with configurable search patterns, so-called regular expressions. 

The version offered on the OpenOffice extensions website is outdated; a current version can be downloaded from the project homepage:

Pepito Cleaner 0.1.16 works equally well with OpenOffice 3.4.1 and with the OpenOffice 4.2.0 Developer build. However, it did not work for me with LibreOffice 7.0.5.2.

The default regular expressions in Pepito Cleaner recognize quotation marks as they are common in the USA, also  "guillemets"  as used for example in Italy and Switzerland. In order for Pepito Cleaner to recognize the in Germany and Austria commonly used inverted commas („…“) and chevrons (»…«) as opening and closing quotation marks, the user has to change the regular expressions himself. However, such changes require expertise and are not easy to transfer to other installations. Moreover, they will be lost again when Pepito Cleaner is updated or reinstalled.

Since Pepito Cleaner seems to be no longer maintained, the developers are not identifiable, and the license terms of the software are unclear, I have programmed the extension "poemenia", which helps to localize a Pepito Cleaner installation from the outside. Currently the option is available for Germany and Austria (de-DE).
